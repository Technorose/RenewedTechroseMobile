## Built With

React Native: React Native was used in the development of the mobile application. It provides a single codebase that can run on both iOS and Android platforms, thus accelerating the development process and reducing costs.

fetch: The fetch library is employed for making HTTP requests and communicating with the server. It manages data exchange processes and enables user interaction with the platform.

React Native Navigation: React Native Navigation is utilized for managing the user interface. It simplifies navigation within the application and enhances the user experience.

Asp.Net Core Api Integration: Asp.Net Core Api integration is implemented to manage backend data processing and server logic. It ensures secure processing and storage of user data.

React Native Chart Kit: React Native Chart Kit is a library used to visualize data in React Native-based mobile applications. This library provides components to create various types of charts (such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc.) and enables these charts to be displayed in a user-friendly manner in mobile applications.

1) Data Visualization: It's important for users of a diabetes application to visually track their health data, such as blood sugar levels, dietary habits, exercise activities, etc. React Native Chart Kit presents this data in attractive charts, making it easier for users to understand

2) User Experience: Charts allow users to analyze their health data more quickly and effectively, enhancing the user experience and making the application more user-friendly.

3) Customization: With the variety of chart types and configuration options offered by React Native Chart Kit, you can easily customize the charts in the diabetes application to fit the requirements of the application. For example, you can create a line chart showing the trend of blood sugar levels over a specific time period.

4) Data Analysis: Charts enable users to analyze their data in depth, helping them better understand health trends and changes over specific time periods.


React Native Tailwind: React Native Tailwind, is an adapted version of Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework used in React Native applications.
